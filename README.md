# How to contribute

## Step 1: Picking up an issue

If working on an issue, comment first that you are working on it and then send out the pull request.

## Step 2: Folder structure and conventions

### Folder structure:

1. **If only single solution exists**        
`#<problem_number>/<file_name>`

**Example**
```
#200/Solution.java
```

2. **If more than one approach exist**        
`#<problem_number>/<approach_algorithm_name>/<file_name>`

**Example**
```
#354/dfs/Solution.java
#354/union_find/Solution.java
```

3. The code should start with comment section having the problem link.

**Example**
```
/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/gas-station/
 */
 class Solution { .... }
```

Note: the algorithm name (if multiple words) follows snake case.

## Step 3: Pull Request

1. While sending out pull request, also attach proof of submission as accepted solution for the code.

## What next?

1. After sending out the PR, consider SLA of 2 days for review of the PR and getting a response back. In case of SLA failure, feel free to leave comment asking for review or merge.
2. Feel free to open new issues for different leetcode questions. I will assign the `hacktoberfest` tag while you can send out PR without waiting.
